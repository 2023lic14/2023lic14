## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently a CS student at Columbia with hands-on experience in **machine learning**, **cybersecurity**, and **web development**. I’ve worked on everything from training U-Net models for medical imaging to leading malware analysis investigations and building AI-enabled web apps. As is true for all my projects, I love combining **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.

📌 *Ask me about training CNNs to denoise MRI images, creating a student-friendly SNAP eligibility checker, or reverse engineering malware at MIT Beaver Works!*
