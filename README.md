## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently a CS student at Columbia with hands-on experience in **machine learning**, **cybersecurity**, and **software & web development**. I’ve worked on everything from training U-Net models for medical imaging to leading malware analysis investigations and building AI-enabled web apps. As is true for all my projects, I love combining **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.

📌 *Ask me about training CNNs to denoise MRI images, creating a student-friendly SNAP eligibility checker, or investigating malware at MIT Beaver Works!*

## 💡 Projects

## 🌐 [SNAP for Students](https://github.com/jaysonedu/devfest2025.git) *(Feb 2025)*
Problem: A study by UC Davis found that 19% to 56% of U.S. college students struggle with food insecurity. Many students would assume they don’t qualify, and the NYC online SNAP application is outdated and difficult to navigate. 
Solution: We created a website, SNAP for students, to make the process more digestible. Our site is a full-stack website to simplify SNAP benefits access for students  
- Built the frontend using React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
- Designed and implemented a MongoDB-powered forum with comment-liking, upvoting/downvoting, post sorting, and reply features and utilized Node.js for backend functionality 
- Integrated an OpenAI-powered chatbot with prompt engineering and eligibility quiz to help users determine SNAP qualification

### 🧱 [A* Rubik’s Cube Solver](#) *(May 2025)*  
A Python-based solver using A* search with a custom heuristic  
- Avoids redundant moves and optimizes for efficiency  
- Inspired by 10+ years of personal cubing experience

### 🧾 [HTTP 1.0 Web Server in C](#) *(Dec 2024)*  
Built a TCP-based HTTP server from scratch in C  
- Handles static + dynamic content, error handling, and logging  
- Implements directory traversal protection and IP tracking

### 🔤 [Anagrams Finder](#) *(May 2024)*  
Java program to find anagrams using advanced data structures  
- Used Hashmaps, Red-Black Trees, and Linked Lists for fast lookup
