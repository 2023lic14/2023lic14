## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently a CS student at Columbia with hands-on experience in **machine learning**, **cybersecurity**, and **web development**. I’ve worked on everything from training U-Net models for medical imaging to leading malware analysis investigations and building AI-enabled web apps. As is true for all my projects, I love combining **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.

📌 *Ask me about training CNNs to denoise MRI images, creating a student-friendly SNAP eligibility checker, or investigating malware at MIT Beaver Works!*

## 🔬 Experience

### 🧠 **Research Assistant @ University of Minnesota CMMR Lab**  
*Jul 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Built a U-Net model using PyTorch to denoise MRI images
- Used Matlab to preprocess and become familiar with the datasets
- Conducted training and testing on supercomputer through VNC
- Tools: Python, Linux, Matlab, Git, VNC

### 🤖 **Break Through Tech AI @ Cornell Tech**  
*May 2025 – August 2025*  
- Completed and received certificate for Cornell University's ML Foundations course
- Preprocessed large datasets (Windzorizing, filling missing data, one-hot-encoding, n-gram creation, lemmatization, stop word removal)
- Built and deployed classification and clustering models (KNNs, Decision Trees, Linear/Logistic Regression, CNNs etc.)
- Employed model selection, ensemble, and tuning methods to create more refined models (Cross-validation, Grid Search, Stacking, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Evaluated ML models' functionality by interpreting metrics and confusion matrices, AUC-ROC curves, etc.
- Built efficient NNs trained using stochastic gradient descent (Sentiment Analysis, Image Classification)

*August 2025 – May 2026*
- Will work with mentors in the industry along with a team of peers to apply ML knowledge to the real world in impactful ways (Project Pending)

### 🛡️ **Beaver Works Summer Institute @ MIT – Cyber Ops Class Leader**  
*Jun 2022 – Aug 2022*  
- Led OSINT team to profile Raccoon Stealer malware  
- Used tools like VirusTotal, Metasploit, Zeek, and Wireshark  
- Presented findings to an audience for Beaver Works' Summer Showcase
