## üöÄ About Me

I'm currently a CS student at Columbia with hands-on experience in **machine learning**, **cybersecurity**, and **software & web development**. I‚Äôve worked on everything from training U-Net models for medical imaging to leading malware analysis investigations and building AI-enabled web apps. As is true for all my projects, I love combining **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.

Aside from CS, I love playing video games and board games, drawing, cubing, and traveling! Ask me about **Tetris** or my recent trip to **Peru**!

## üí° Projects

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Identifying Possible Systemic Gender Discrimination Using ML](https://github.com/2023lic14/breakthroughtechai) *(July 2025)*
Problem: Gender discrimination is a prominent issue in America. What is a way to show it exists?

Solution: By training a neural network on US census data, we could identify, based on the accuracy of the model, if there were statistically significant differences between gender using demographic data that are not directly relate to gender such as education, occupation, income, etc. Then, by identifying a difference, we are able to investigate* whether or not systemic discrimination is present

> *This project is exploratory and not intended to assign causality. Further investigation is necessary to interpret correlations ethically and accurately.*

- Faithfully followed the procedures of the ML lifecycle
- Preprocessed and conducted feature engineering on the 1994 US census data (windzorized all numerical columns, filled missing entries, one-hot encoded all categorical columns, removed irrelevant features, identified and addressed class imbalance, split train and test data, etc.)
- Trained using Tensorflow Keras' Sequential model with 3 hidden layers of 32, 16, and a 8 units fine-tuned to avoid over/underfitting and uses SGD to optimize performance
- After 100 epochs, accuracy testing resulted in a loss of 0.4567 and accuracy of 0.7775. Created confusion matrix identifying high count of Type II error

Conclusion: The model performed well, though not exceptionally, still signifying statistical correlation between demographic information and gender identity**


*It is important to conduct investigation as to which features are most strongly correlated with these results. Categories such as occupation and income may be correlated with gender in a non-discriminatory way. Next steps to do so include plotting features against the label to determine highest correlation.

**This type of ML model has the potential to be used unethically. That is not the intention of this project.

### üî¢ [Neural Network From Scratch](https://github.com/2023lic14/Neural-Network-From-Scratch) *(June 2025)* 
Created a convolutional neural network from scratch inside kaggle using no ML libraries, only linear algebra using NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib
- Trained on the MNIST dataset, the model was able to achieve above an 80% accuracy rate, further training may allow better performance

### üß± [A* NxN Rubik‚Äôs Cube Solver](https://github.com/coms2132-sp25/final-project-2023lic14) *(May 2025)*  
After cubing for 10+ years and still not being able to achieve a sub-20 second solve on the 3x3, I began wondering if I could create a a Python-based solver using A* that would find better solves than me. 
- Implemented an A* search algorithm using a priority queue with a custom heuristic
- Avoids redundant moves and optimizes for efficiency by using a pruning algorithm
- Uses a max height variable that corresponds to the NxN cube's God's number (the maximum number of moves needed to solve any given cube state in the least rotations)

### üåê [SNAP for Students](https://github.com/jaysonedu/devfest2025) *(Feb 2025)*
Problem: A study by UC Davis found that 19% to 56% of U.S. college students struggle with food insecurity. Many students would assume they don‚Äôt qualify, and the NYC online SNAP application is outdated and difficult to navigate. 

Solution: We created a website, SNAP for students, to make the process more digestible. Our site is a full-stack website to simplify SNAP benefits access for students  
- Built the frontend using React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
